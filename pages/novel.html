                    <p>Over the next few weeks, we found ways to be alone together. Quick encounters when my mother was out, whispered conversations that carried double meanings when she was nearby.</p>

                    <p>One afternoon, while my mother was at a friend's house, Nate cornered me in the kitchen. "This has to stop," he said, but his eyes told a different story.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Do you really want it to stop?" I challenged, stepping closer.</p>
                    
                    <p>He didn't answer with words. Instead, his mouth crashed against mine in a kiss that was all hunger and desperation. My back pressed against the refrigerator as his hands roamed my body, rediscovering curves he already knew by heart.</p>
